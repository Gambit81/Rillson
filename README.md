<h2>Testing</h2>

*   I tested that this page works in the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge

*   I was able to verify that this project is capable of adapting to various screen sizes while maintaining an attractive appearance and full functionality by utilizing the devtools.

*   I have verified that the navigation, header, about, practice, subscribe, and "Join Us" text are legible and comprehensible.

*   I have ascertained that the form is operational, as it mandates entries in all fields, only accepts a valid email format in the email field. 

*   The submit button dosen´t have a validate form data, so it´s a mockup.

<h2>Validator Testing</h2>

* HTML  

    * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C HTML validator.

<h2>Development Process</h2>

*   From start to finish of this first project, it has been an amazing journey.<br> 
The hardest and I´m still struggling with it, is the media queries. I have used: 

    1   [Code Institute Fullstack Course](https://codeinstitute.net) 

    2   [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp)

    3   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69IbzTWg5PM)

    Even though I have read, watch content and coding on my own, I can´t get it right.<br>
    All other coding, I had the [Love Running](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template/blob/master/README.md) project as a reference to go by in a structured way.
    
    *   Also the README file, I did at the end of the project. Which now in hindsight, It was best to start at the beginning as the memory is short and I´m struggling now on how I went by with every small problem and how I fixed it.<br> 
    My mentor helped me a lot to understand the structure way of how a good coder has to work and I´m taking this valuable lesson with me to the next project.

<h2>Known Bugs</h2>

*   On some mobile devices the images pushes the size of screen less than any of the other content on the page.
