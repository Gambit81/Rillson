		<h2>About</h2>
		<h3> Mindfulness is the practice of being present and fully engaged in the current moment, without judgment or distraction. 
			 It involves a heightened awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and a conscious effort to remain focused on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. 
			 Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, increase emotional regulation, and improve overall well-being.

		<p>There are many ways to practice mindfulness, but here are some general steps that can be helpful:
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Find a quiet and comfortable place where you won't be interrupted.</li>
				<li>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and take a few deep breaths.</li>
				<li>Bring your attention to the present moment and focus on your breath, noticing the sensations of your breath moving in and out of your body.</li>
				<li>If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your attention back to your breath without judgment or criticism.</li>
				<li>Expand your awareness to include your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without getting caught up in them. Simply observe them as they come and go.</li>
				<li>Practice for a few minutes to start with, gradually increasing the length of your practice over time.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			Other ways to practice mindfulness include mindful walking, eating, and even washing dishes. 
			The key is to bring a non-judgmental and curious awareness to whatever you are doing, without getting lost in thoughts or distractions.
