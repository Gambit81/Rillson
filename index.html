		<h2>About</h2>
		<br>
			 Mindfulness is the practice of being present and fully engaged in the current moment, without judgment or distraction. 
			 It involves a heightened awareness of one's thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and a conscious effort to remain focused on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. 
			 Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, increase emotional regulation, and improve overall well-being.

		<br>
		<p>There are many ways to practice mindfulness, but here are some general steps that can be helpful:
			<br>
			<ol id="numbers">
				<li>Find a quiet place to meditate.</li>
				<li>Get comfortable and breathe deeply.</li>
				<li>Focus on your breath and be present.</li>
				<li>Gently bring your mind back to your breath if it wanders.</li>
				<li>Observe your thoughts, emotions, and sensations without getting caught up in them.</li>
				<li>Start with a few minutes and increase over time.</li>
				
			</ol>
			<br>
			Other ways to practice mindfulness include mindful walking, eating, and even washing dishes. 
			The key is to bring a non-judgmental and curious awareness to whatever you are doing, without getting lost in thoughts or distractions.
